## Projects
- [BankStar-Service](https://github.com/samka-bogomola-02/BankStar-service) - BankStar-Service is a microservice that functions as a marketing system, offering recommendations for banking products to customers based on specific criteria formulated as dynamic rules. These recommendations are displayed in a mobile app with suggestions like, "Check out our new advantageous loan."
The app also features a Telegram bot that provides personalized recommendations to users, addressing them by name. To enhance efficiency, the system caches database queries and maintains detailed statistics on the triggering of dynamic rules.
In this way, BankStar-Service delivers relevant and personalized offers to customers, improving their interaction with banking products.
- [Makstor](https://github.com/samka-bogomola-02/makstoreshop) - Makstor is a web application on Telegram that serves as an online store for electronic cigarettes. The service allows administrators to add, edit, and delete products with various specifications and images through a Telegram bot. Users can easily create a shopping cart and place orders at wholesale and retail prices. All orders are then sent to the administrator via a separate bot as an Excel file.
